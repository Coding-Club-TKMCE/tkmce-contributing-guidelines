# Coding Club Organization

Welcome to the Coding Club Organization! We are a student-led group dedicated to fostering a collaborative and innovative environment for coders at TKM College of Engineering. Our goal is to provide resources, support, and opportunities for students to enhance their programming skills and contribute to exciting projects.

## Purpose

The Coding Club Organization aims to:

- **Encourage Collaboration:** Facilitate teamwork on various coding projects and open-source initiatives.
- **Promote Learning:** Provide a platform for students to learn new technologies and improve their coding skills through workshops, tutorials, and hands-on projects.
- **Support Innovation:** Encourage students to develop creative solutions and contribute to real-world applications.
- **Build Community:** Create a vibrant community of programmers who can share knowledge, collaborate, and network.

## Future Goals

As we move forward, our focus will be on:

- **Expanding Projects:** Launching new projects and enhancing existing ones to cover a broader range of technologies and applications.
- **Organizing Events:** Hosting coding competitions, hackathons, and guest lectures to keep the community engaged and learning.
- **Fostering Industry Connections:** Building partnerships with industry professionals to provide students with career guidance and internship opportunities.
- **Improving Resources:** Continuously updating and expanding our resources to support the needs of our members.

## Code Ownership

In our repositories, we use the `CODEOWNERS` file to ensure that contributions are reviewed by the appropriate individuals or teams. This process helps maintain high code quality and ensures that expertise is applied to specific areas of the codebase.

### Priority of Code Ownership

- **Primary Code Owners:** The individual or team responsible for a specific part of the codebase. They are required to review and approve pull requests that affect their areas of ownership.
- **Secondary Code Owners:** Individuals or teams with additional responsibilities for the codebase. They may be consulted for additional input but are not required to review all changes.

### Example CODEOWNERS File

Hereâ€™s an example of what a `CODEOWNERS` file might look like: 

```bash
# Default code owners for the entire repository
* @student-lead @tech-lead

# Specific code owners for directories
/src/ @backend-team
/docs/ @docs-team
/scripts/ @scripts-team
```
#### Explanation

- `* @username1 @username2`: The specified users are the default code owners for the entire repository.
- `/src/ @team-backend`: The specified team is responsible for the `src` directory.
- `/docs/ @team-docs`: The specified team is responsible for the `docs` directory.
  
For detailed information on code ownership and responsibilities, please refer to the [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) file in each repository. This file specifies the code owners for different parts of the repository and outlines the review process.
