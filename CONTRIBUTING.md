# Contributing to TKM College of Engineering GitHub Organization

Welcome to the TKM College of Engineering GitHub Organization! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our projects. This document outlines the workflow and guidelines for contributing effectively.

## Workflow Overview

Our workflow is divided into five stages, each handled by dedicated teams. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Development:**
   - The Development team is responsible for writing new code and implementing features.
   - Create a branch named `development` for ongoing development work.
   - Push your changes to this branch and open a pull request for review.

2. **Modification:**
   - The Modification team reviews the code from the Development stage and makes necessary changes.
   - Create a branch named `modification` for this stage.
   - Ensure all modifications are tested before merging.

3. **Testing:**
   - The Testing team conducts thorough testing of the code to ensure it meets quality standards.
   - Create a branch named `testing` for this stage.
   - Document any issues found and work with the Modification team to resolve them.

4. **Deployment:**
   - The Deployment team prepares the code for release and deploys it to the production environment.
   - Create a branch named `deployment` for deployment tasks.
   - Ensure all deployment procedures are followed and document any changes made.

5. **Documentation:**
   - The Documentation team creates and updates project documentation.
   - Create a branch named `documentation` for documentation updates.
   - Ensure all documentation is accurate and up-to-date.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
     ```

3. **Create a Feature Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

4. **Make Your Changes:**
   - Implement your changes and test them locally.

5. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of your changes"
     ```

6. **Push to Your Fork:**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

7. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Open a pull request from your branch to the relevant stage branch in the original repository.

## Additional Guidelines

- Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- Provide clear and detailed commit messages.
- Engage with the team for code reviews and feedback.
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
